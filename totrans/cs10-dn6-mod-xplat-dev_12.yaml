    created, has resources like memory and threads allocated to it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A **thread** executes your code, statement by statement. By default, each process
    only has one thread, and this can cause problems when we need to do more than
    one task at the same time. Threads are also responsible for keeping track of things
    like the currently authenticated user and any internationalization rules that
    should be followed for the current language and region.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Windows and most other modern operating systems use **preemptive multitasking**,
    which simulates the parallel execution of tasks. It divides the processor time
    among the threads, allocating a **time slice** to each thread one after another.
    The current thread is suspended when its time slice finishes. The processor then
    allows another thread to run for a time slice.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When Windows switches from one thread to another, it saves the context of the
    thread and reloads the previously saved context of the next thread in the thread
    queue. This takes both time and resources to complete.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a developer, if you have a small number of complex pieces of work and you
    want complete control over them, then you could create and manage individual `Thread`
    instances. If you have one main thread and multiple small pieces of work that
    can be executed in the background, then you can use the `ThreadPool` class to
    add delegate instances that point to those pieces of work implemented as methods
    to a queue, and they will be automatically allocated to threads in the thread
    pool.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we will use the `Task` type to manage threads at a higher abstraction
    level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Threads may have to compete for and also wait for access to shared resources,
    such as variables, files, and database objects. There are types for managing this
    that you will see in action later in this chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Depending on the task, doubling the number of threads (workers) to perform a
    task does not halve the number of seconds that it will take to complete that task.
    In fact, it can increase the duration of the task.

    the one that requires the fewest bytes of memory. But if we only need to store

    that long- running tasks were executed by a non-UI thread, but once complete,
    the results of the task were safely passed to the UI thread to present to the

    allow you to continue to write your code as if it is synchronous, which keeps
    your code clean and easy to understand, but underneath, the C# compiler creates
    a complex state machine and keeps track of running threads. It's kind of magical!

    types like `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand`, and `SqlDataReader`. You will only be
    able to complete this task if you have Windows and the Northwind database stored
    in SQL Server. This is the only section in this book that is not cross-platform

    I thought this task would be a good opportunity to at least see an example app
    built using WPF even if we do not look at it in detail.

    taken for a request to return). So, from a single client's point of view, the

    their experience worse!
