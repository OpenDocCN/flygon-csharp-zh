  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A **stream** is a sequence of bytes that can be read from and written to. Although
    files can be processed rather like arrays, with random access provided by knowing
    the position of a byte within the file, it can be useful to process files as a
    stream in which the bytes can be accessed in sequential order.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Streams can also be used to process terminal input and output and networking
    resources such as sockets and ports that do not provide random access and cannot
    seek (that is, move) to a position. You can write code to process some arbitrary
    bytes without knowing or caring where it comes from. Your code simply reads or
    writes to a stream, and another piece of code handles where the bytes are actually
    stored.
