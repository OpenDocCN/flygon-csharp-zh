- en: There are programming books that are thousands of pages long that aim to be
    comprehensive references for the C# language, .NET libraries, app models like
    websites, services, and desktop, and mobile apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is different. It is concise and aims to be a brisk, fun read packed
    with practical hands-on walkthroughs of each subject. The breadth of the overarching
    narrative comes at the cost of some depth, but you will find many signposts to
    explore further if you wish.

- en: This book is simultaneously a step-by-step guide to learning modern C# proven
    practices using cross-platform .NET and a brief introduction to the main types
    of practical applications that can be built with them. This book is best for beginners
    to C# and .NET, or programmers who have worked with C# in the past but feel left
    behind by the changes in the past few years.

    colleagues and get productive fast. Rather than slowing down and boring some readers
    by explaining every little thing, I will assume that you are smart enough to Google
    an explanation for topics that are related but not necessary to include in a beginner-to-intermediate
    guide that has limited space in the printed book.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Hello, C#! Welcome, .NET!*, is about setting up your development
    environment and using either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code to create the
    simplest application possible with C# and .NET. For simplified console apps, you
    will see the use of the top-level program feature introduced in C# 9\. For learning
    how to write simple language constructs and library features, you will see the
    use of .NET Interactive Notebooks. You will also learn about some good places
    to look for help and ways to contact me to get help with an issue or give me feedback
    to improve the book and future editions through its GitHub repository.'

    which versions introduced new features. I explain the grammar and vocabulary that
    you will use every day to write the source code for your applications. In particular,
    you will learn how to declare and work with variables of different types.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *Controlling Flow, Converting Types, and Handling Exceptions*,
    covers using operators to perform simple actions on variables, including comparisons,
    writing code that makes decisions, pattern matching in C# 7 to C# 10, repeating
    a block of statements, and converting between types. It also covers writing code
    defensively to handle exceptions when they inevitably occur.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Writing, Debugging, and Testing Functions*, is about following
    the **Don''t Repeat Yourself** (**DRY**) principle by writing reusable functions
    using both imperative and functional implementation styles. You will also learn
    how to use debugging tools to track down and remove bugs, monitoring your code
    while it executes to diagnose problems, and rigorously testing your code to remove
    bugs and ensure stability and reliability before it gets deployed into production.'

    all the different categories of members that a type can have, including fields
    to store data and methods to perform actions. You will use **object-oriented programming**
    (**OOP**) concepts, such as aggregation and encapsulation. You will learn about
    language features such as tuple syntax support and `out` variables, default literals,
    and inferred tuple names, as well as how to define and work with immutable types
    using the `record` keyword, `init`-only properties, and `with` expressions introduced
    in C# 9.'

    and derived classes, how to override a member of a type, how to use polymorphism,
    how to create extension methods, how to cast between classes in an inheritance
    hierarchy, and about the big change in C# 8 with the introduction of nullable
    reference types.'
