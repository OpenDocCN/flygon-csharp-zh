    for articles with more discussion of this.
  prefs: []

- en: Usually, when a type implements `IDisposable`, you should create it inside a
    `using` statement to ensure that it is disposed of as soon as possible. `HttpClient`
    is different because it is shared, reentrant, and partially thread-safe.
  prefs: []

    The bottom line is that you should use a single instance of it for each HTTP endpoint
    that you consume during the life of your application. This will allow each `HttpClient`
    instance to have defaults set that are appropriate for the endpoint it works with,
    while managing the underlying network sockets efficiently.
